# NuclearSpinSimulation
We examine the impact of NV-control infidelities on nuclear-spin superposition states.
This Monte-Carlo simulation suite builds on the analytic results of [1].

Can handle the following experimental imperfections:

- Microwave pulse infidelities.
- NV initialization infidelities.
- Exponentially distributed repumping noise if the NV is in -1/+1 (similar to [1])
- Gaussian quasi-static distribution of the average NV repumping time
