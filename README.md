# NuclearSpinSimulation
This Monte-Carlo simulation suite builds on the analytic results of Blok et al., Farad. Discuss. 184, 173 (2015).

Can handle the following experimental imperfections:

- MW pulse errors
- NV initialization infidelity with equal distribution to ms = -1 and ms = +1
- Exponentially distributed repumping if the NV is in -1/+1 (similar to Blok et al.)
- Gaussian quasi-static distribution of the average NV repumping time
